It stands to reason, then, that a change in their family’s situation, like a lost job or a new higher-paying one, is unlikely to change their perceptions on their social class. Particularly because <a href=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2013/08/why-americans-all-believe-they-are-middle-class/278240/ target=_blank>for many people</a>, the “middle class” is <a href=https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2018/09/04/there-are-many-definitions-of-middle-class-heres-ours/ target=_blank>just as much</a> about your education, job, resources, and aspirations as it is about your paycheck.

Many researchers ultimately use household income and thus numerically locate the families that are in the middle of that income range.

Have they spanned the entire income range and gone all the way from lower class to upper class (or upper class to lower)? Have they stayed pretty close to the middle, moving only to upper-middle or lower-middle income levels? Tell us what you think."}],"movingQ":"What’s the furthest you think most families have moved?","movingSetup":"Drag the bars below to show us how many quintiles you think middle income families have moved over the past 50 years.","postMoving":[{"type":"text","value":"As the chart above shows, middle class families are actually quite mobile. Nearly all families move at least one quintile during their lifetimes, with nearly half moving two quintiles. Interestingly, more middle class families moved four quintiles - meaning they experienced both the top and bottom quintiles at least once - than did those that only shifted up or down one quintile from the middle."}],"histTitle":"Families are actually quite fluid in income distribution","histSetup":"We know that some families have moved several quintiles over the past 50 years. But even those moves don’t happen just once. The families in this study frequently move from one income level to another year to year. Just watch as we count up how many years our 11,172 families have cumulatively spent at each income level.","postHist":[{"type":"text","value":"The paths these families have taken suggest that American families can potentially experience a wide variety of financial situations over the course of their lifetimes. While some families do remain in a fairly consistent place along the income distribution, many others move up and down quite significantly with some making it from the very bottom to the very top and others going from one of the upper income quintiles to the lower ones, sometimes in the span of just a few years!"}],"method":[{"type":"text","value":"The analysis for this piece was based on data from the <a href=https://psidonline.isr.umich.edu/#gsc.tab=0 target=_blank>Panel Survey on Income Dynamics (PSID)</a>. This survey, run by the University of Michigan, has tracked the same nationally representative sample of American families over time, asking them a variety of questions about topics such as employment, income, wealth, family structure, education, and health. It is the longest running longitudinal household survey in the world, beginning in 1968. From 1968 to 1997, the survey was conducted annually; after 1997, the survey was run every other year. Our data thus spans 1968 to 2017, the most recent wave of data publicly available."},{"type":"text","value":"Our analysis looks at family-level income, defined as the sum of all taxable and transfer income from all members of the family, from which we constructed an entire income distribution for each year of the survey. These distributions then allowed us to determine the percentile each family fell in based on their income level and from there, the quintile they belonged to. We chose to look at income per family rather than individual since we felt that individuals in the same household would share financial resources. Because we wanted to focus on families in their prime earning years for a more accurate picture of their financial situation, we restricted our sample to families where the head was at least 25 years old. Additionally, families had to have at least five years of observations to be included in our analysis so that we would have enough data to track their standing in the income distribution over time. This resulted in a sample of 11,172 families."},{"type":"text","value":"Some caveats to our analysis include not adjusting for the household size even though the number of individuals affects how far a set amount of income can go. Since most national statistics on income are reported without such an adjustment, we chose not to adjust our own numbers in order to be consistent even though not doing so might not paint the most accurate picture of how families are doing. Similarly, we did not include a cost of living adjustment to account for differences between high- and low-cost areas. Finally, our analysis for this piece looks at income rather than wealth because we had more years of data for the former than the latter even though wealth also plays an important role in families’ financial well-being."}]}
